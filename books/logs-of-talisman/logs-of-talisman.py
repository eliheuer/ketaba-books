Brent:  The distinction between Revelation (vahy) and inspiration (ilham) 
is very strong in the original languages, but it is not so stark in 
English.  Thus, the beloved Guardian occasionally translates vahy as 
inspiration, though mostly as revelation.  And occasionally "ilham" or 
inspiration is rendered as revelation.

This is what is going on when Shoghi Effendi speaks of `Abdu'l-Baha as 
"revealing" a Tablet.  It is a matter of loose translation into a 
language with different resonances.  I guarantee you that he does not 
mean "vahy" by this language and that in Arabic or Persian the beloved 
Guardian *never* associated "vahy" or divine Revelation with `Abdu'l-Baha 
or indeed with anyone but a Manifestation of God.

Likewise, no Baha'i text bestows on `Abdu'l-Baha the right of divine 
Legislation (shari`ah), and the Master would have been horrified at the 
thought.
